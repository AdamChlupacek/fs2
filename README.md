### <a id="about"></a>About the library ###

FS2 is a streaming I/O library. The design goals are compositionality, expressiveness, resource safety, and speed. Here's a simple example of its use:

``` scala
import fs2.{io, text}
import fs2.util.Task
import java.nio.file.Paths

def fahrenheitToCelsius(f: Double): Double =
  (f - 32.0) * (5.0/9.0)

val converter: Task[Unit] =
  io.file.readAll[Task](Paths.get("testdata/fahrenheit.txt"), 4096)
    .through(text.utf8Decode)
    .through(text.lines)
    .filter(s => !s.trim.isEmpty && !s.startsWith("//"))
    .map(line => fahrenheitToCelsius(line.toDouble).toString)
    .intersperse("\n")
    .through(text.utf8Encode)
    .through(io.file.writeAll(Paths.get("testdata/celsius.txt")))
    .run

// at the end of the universe...
val u: Unit = converter.unsafeRun
```

This will construct a `Task`, `converter`, which reads lines incrementally from `testdata/fahrenheit.txt`, skipping blanklines and commented lines. It then parses temperatures in degrees fahrenheit, converts these to celsius, UTF-8 encodes the output and writes incrementally to `testdata/celsius.txt`, using constant memory. The input and output files will be closed in the event of normal termination or exceptions.

The library supports a number of other interesting use cases:

* _Zipping and merging of streams:_ A streaming computations may read from multiple sources in a streaming fashion, zipping or merging their elements using a arbitrary `Tee`. In general, clients have a great deal of flexibility in what sort of topologies they can define--source, sinks, and effectful channels are all first-class concepts in the library.
* _Dynamic resource allocation:_ A streaming computation may allocate resources dynamically (for instance, reading a list of files to process from a stream built off a network socket), and the library will ensure these resources get released in the event of normal termination or when errors occur.
* _Nondeterministic and concurrent processing:_ A computation may read from multiple input streams simultaneously, using whichever result comes back first, and a pipeline of transformation can allow for nondeterminism and queueing at each stage.

### <a id="getit"></a> Where to get the latest version ###

The 0.9 release is coming soon and you can start using the milestone release now. You may want to first [read the migration guide](docs/migration-guide.md) if you are upgrading from 0.8 or earlier.

```
// available for Scala 2.11.8, 2.12.0-M4
libraryDependencies += "co.fs2" %% "fs2-core" % "0.9.0-M2"

// optional I/O library
libraryDependencies += "co.fs2" %% "fs2-io" % "0.9.0-M2"
```

* [The core library](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/releases/archive/co/fs2/fs2-core_2.11/0.9.0-M2/fs2-core_2.11-0.9.0-M2-javadoc.jar/!/index.html#package)
* [The `io` library](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/releases/archive/co/fs2/fs2-io_2.11/0.9.0-M2/fs2-io_2.11-0.9.0-M2-javadoc.jar/!/index.html#package), FS2 bindings for NIO-based file I/O and TCP networking, and (coming soon) UDP

The latest stable release is 0.8 ([source](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2/tree/release/0.8)). To get it, add the following to your SBT build:

```
// available for Scala 2.10.5, 2.11.7, 2.12.0-M1, 2.12.0-M2
libraryDependencies += "org.scalaz.stream" %% "scalaz-stream" % "0.8"
```
